                <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
                <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>
                    is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the 
                    release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                </p>
                <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
                <p>
                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
                    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a 
                    Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin 
                    words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in 
                    classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 
                    and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written 
                    in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
                    The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
                    Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their 
                    exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

                <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
                <p>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a 
                    page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
                    normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look 
                    like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum 
                    as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in 
                    their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on 
                    purpose (injected humour and the like).
                </p>
                <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered 
                    alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly 
                    believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything 
                    embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to 
                    repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses 
                    a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate 
                    Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, 
                    injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

            <p>
                "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will 
                give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the 
                master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but 
                because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 
                Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because 
                occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
                which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right 
                to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain 
                that produces no resultant pleasure?"
