Web development and web design share many commonalities, but they differ in some key areas. Web design deals with the front-end of a website, concerning itself with appearance and user experience. ----Web development---, on the other hand, deals with building technical front-end and/or back-end code that informs site function. Web developers may work exclusively on front-end code, back-end code, or both, and many modern jobs also require overlap into web design. These professionals may work independently on a freelance basis or with marketing or IT departments.
